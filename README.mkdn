# crDroid build script #

### Description ###

This bash script is used to build crDroid and upload via FTP.
With proper settings, it's also possible to push to crDroid AFH page automatically.

### How to Install

In order to install this, all it's needed to be done is copy buildCR script locally, set it as executable, configure FTP settings and set your build devices in devices.txt file.
To do so run following commands:

```bash
# Download the script with curl
$ curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crdroidandroid/build_crDroid/master/buildCR
# Make script executable
$ chmod +x buildCR
# Create devices.txt 
$ echo > devices.txt
```

### Configuration

We now need to configure buildCR and devices codenames that we want to build for.

Open buildCR and change according to your needs the following lines.

```bash
#   << Start configuration >>
#crDroid_path is the location of build environment root path aka {ANDROID_BUILD_TOP}
crDroid_path=~/Desktop/CR
#set how much RAM is used by JACK if building with
RAM=12
#CCache size
ccachesize=30G
#set if you want to save changelog file to script_path (from where the script runs) at end of build (useful to add changelog info to forums and so on... easy to find)
copy_changelog=true
#FTP config
upload_build=true
FTP_hostname="ftp://domain.tld"
FTP_username=username
FTP_password=password
#   << End configuration >>
```

Now open devices.txt and set your build devices like in example below.
You can also comment out with "#" if you want a device to be skipped for building (see 3rd line from example below - commented with #)

    <device codename>,<FTP upload path>
    herolte,auto/SamsungGalaxyS7S7edgeSMG93XX/173942-herolte
    #herolte,auto/SamsungGalaxyS7S7edgeSMG93XX/173942-herolte 

**FTP upload path** - ask crDroid staff via our Telegram channel for this path according to your device (this is useful for auto import to AFH)

### Start building

In order to start building, issue the following command

    $ ./buildCR
